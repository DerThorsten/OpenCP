**void SLIC(Mat& src, Mat& segment, int regionSize, float regularization, float minRegionRatio, int max_iteration)**  
* Mat& src: input image.  
* Nat& dest: destination image.  
* int regionSize: nominal size of the regions.   
* float regularzation: a trade-off between appearance and spatial terms, and input image is normized (0 to 1).
* int minRegionRatio: ratio of minimum size of a segment for regionSize*regionSize.   
* int max_iteration: number of max interations.
