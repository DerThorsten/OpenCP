**void SLIC(Mat& src, Mat& dest, unsigned int regionSize, float regularization, int minRegionSize, int max_iteration)**  
* Mat& src: input image.  
* Nat& dest: destination image.  
* int regionSize: nominal size of the regions.   
* float regularzation: a trade-off between appearance and spatial terms.  
* int minRegionSize: minimum size of a segment.   
* int max_iteration: number of max interations.
